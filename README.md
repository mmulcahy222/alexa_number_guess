# Amazon Number Guess

I made a game for Amazon Alexa for a company specializing in VR, E-sports, voice gaming, voice chat, voice multiplayer, and it was a number guessing game, which was the 100 top best selling games in Amazon Alexa for a time.

The modes were Easy, Medium, Hard and they determined how many chances you had at guessing the right number (Easy of course had more)

There are the reviews that the game has garnered on Amazon:
